## Coding and AI joke

I asked an AI to help me debug my code.
It replied, "I'm not a magician, but I can make your errors disappear — by deleting the file."

## More jokes

- Why did the open-source developer bring a ladder to the repository? To climb the next release.
- I asked my computer to help plan a trip to the stars; it replied, "Can't — I'm still stuck in an infinite loop."
